Part 2a:
Write a series of five functions that determine if a given positive integer is EVEN, ODD, PRIME, PERFECT and ABUNDANT. Each of these functions should accept a single integer as an argument and return whether the integer meets the criteria for that classification. 

Once you're happy with your functions you should write a short program to prompt the user for a starting and ending number (both integers) - ensure that the first number is positive, and that the second number is greater than the first number. Then use your functions to analyze all numbers in this range.

Part 2b: Number Analyzer
Next, write a program that prompts the allows the user to analyze numbers within a given range for numbers that fit the above criteria. The program should continue to execute as long as the user wishes to keep going. Your program should rely on the functions you wrote for part 2a - you shouldn't have to re-write the routines that you worked out to compute whether a number is prime, abundant, perfect, odd or even.
